input: aacbbbqq
output: (aa, c, bbb, qq)  
The trick is to match a single char of the range you want, and then make sure you match all
repetitions of the same character:

import re
matcher= re.compile(r'(.)\1*')
[match.group() for match in matcher.finditer('aacbbbqq')]

or using
(\w)\1*


You are given a string . 
Your task is to find the first occurrence of an alphanumeric character in  (read from left to 
right) that has consecutive repetitions.
input: 
..12345678910111213141516171820212223
output:
1

import re

m = re.search(r'([a-zA-Z0-9])\1', input().strip())
print(m.group(1) if m else -1)
